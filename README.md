# DataVisualizationProject
The object of this assignment was to produce four plots using the base R language plotting utilities.  These plots are titled 'plot1.png' through 'plot4.png'.  The code that created each plot is given as 'plot1.R' through 'plot4.R'.

The following was extracted directly from the course assignment directives.

This assignment uses data from the UC Irvine Machine Learning Repository, “Individual household electric power consumption Data Set”, Electric power consumption [20Mb] - Measurements of electric power consumption in one household with a one-minute sampling rate over a period of almost 4 years given as ifferent electrical quantities and some sub-metering values.

The following descriptions of the 9 variables in the dataset are taken from the UCI web site:
1. Date: Date in format dd/mm/yyyy 
2. Time: time in format hh:mm:ss 
3. Global_active_power: household global minute-averaged active power (in kilowatt) 
4. Global_reactive_power: household global minute-averaged reactive power (in kilowatt) 
5. Voltage: minute-averaged voltage (in volt) 
6. Global_intensity: household global minute-averaged current intensity (in ampere) 
7. Sub_metering_1: energy sub-metering No. 1 (in watt-hour of active energy). It corresponds to the kitchen, containing mainly a dishwasher, an oven and a microwave (hot plates are not electric but gas powered). 
8. Sub_metering_2: energy sub-metering No. 2 (in watt-hour of active energy). It corresponds to the laundry room, containing a washing-machine, a tumble-drier, a refrigerator and a light. 
9. Sub_metering_3: energy sub-metering No. 3 (in watt-hour of active energy). It corresponds to an electric water-heater and an air-conditioner.

Considerations when constructing the plots included ...
1. Reduction of the database size whenever possible so that minimal information needed to be processed.
2. Conversion of the Date and Time values to a form readily processed by the R language.
3. Reproduction of plot design and content, including text sizes, labels, bordering, and overall sizes / colors.
4. Including extra commenting so that the examples could serve as future instruction reminders.
5. Checking for and removing any prior plot outputs before creating the image display files.
6. All files uploaded to this GitHub repository.
